# CoronaSafe Engineering Fellowship Test Problem

Thanks for applying to the CoronaSafe Engineering fellowship!

In this step we want to see how you implement a command-line (CLI) program that lets you manage your todos.

The specification for this problem is written down as tests. Since we havenâ€™t actually implemented anything, the tests are currently failing. You have to solve the problem by implementing the application and getting all the tests to pass.

Here's how it should work when you're done:

## Getting started

1. Install Node.js: You need to have npm installed in your computer for this problem. It comes with Node.js and you can get it by installing Node from https://nodejs.org/en/

2. You are expected to write the code in `todo.js` file.

3. Once you are done with the changes you should be able to execute the todo app by running the following command from the terminal.

   **On Windows:**

   ```
   .\todo.bat
   ```

   **On \*nix:**

   ```
   ./todo.sh
   ```
## Run Automated Tests

### 1. Install Node.js

You need to have npm installed in your computer for this problem. It comes with Node.js and you can get it by installing Node from https://nodejs.org/en/

### 2. Install dependencies

Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

### 3. Create Create symbolic link to the executable file

#### On Windows

To create a symbolic link on Windows, you'll need to run either the Windows Command Prompt, or Windows Powershell **with administrator privileges**. To do so, right-click on the icon for Command Prompt, or Powershell, and choose the _"Run as Administrator"_ option.

**Command Prompt:**

```
> mklink todo todo.bat
```

**Powershell:**

```
> cmd /c mklink todo todo.bat
```

#### On \*nix:

Run the following command in your shell:

```
$ ln -s todo.sh todo
```

### 4. Try running tests.

Now run `npm test` and you will see all the tests failing. As you fill in each functionality, you can re-run the tests to see them passing one by one.

## A Note about `/` for Windows Users

In the following sections, you'll see many commands prefixed with `./`, or paths containing the `/` (forward-slash) character.

If you're using the Windows _Command Prompt_, then you'll need to replace `/` with `\` (back-slash) for these commands and paths to work as expected.

On Windows _Powershell_, these substitutions are not required.
