# CoronaSafe Engineering Fellowship Test Problem

Thanks for applying to the CoronaSafe Engineering fellowship!

In this step we want to see how you implement a command-line (CLI) program that lets you manage your todos.

The specification for this problem is written down as tests. Since we havenâ€™t actually implemented anything, the tests are currently failing. You have to solve the problem by implementing the application and getting all the tests to pass.

Here's how it should work when you're done:

## Getting started

1. Install Node.js: You need to have npm installed in your computer for this problem. It comes with Node.js and you can get it by installing Node from https://nodejs.org/en/

2. You are expected to write the code in `todo.js` file.

3. Once you are done with the changes you should be able to execute the todo app by running the following command from the terminal.

   **On Windows:**

   ```
   .\todo.bat
   ```

   **On \*nix:**

   ```
   ./todo.sh
   ```
## Run Automated Tests
